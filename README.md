#### By _**India Lyon-Myrick**_

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET_
* _MSTest_
* _MySQL_

## Description

_A website to host a to-do list. Currently contains a main page to view the user's list, as well as a page to add new items to the list._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need .NET (`https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0`) and MySQL (`https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/25/file/mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.19.0.msi`) in order to run the program._

_1: Clone the repository to a folder of choice on your machine (by either using the "Code" button on the GitHub page, or in a terminal application using `git clone https://github.com/igl-myrick/ToDoList.Solution`)._

_2: Using a terminal application such as Git Bash or Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the top level of the program folder, then into the `ToDoList` folder._

_3: Next, run `dotnet build` in the command line to build the program._

_4: Once the program is built, run `dotnet run` to start the program._

_5: When the program is running, navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to view and use the website._

_6: Optionally, to view tests, enter the `ToDoList.Tests` folder from the top level, run `dotnet restore` to install MSTest packages, and `dotnet test` to run tests._

* _Additionally, you will need to create an `appsettings.json` file within the `ToDoList` folder, including the following code:_

```
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=to_do_list_with_mysqlconnector;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
    }
}
```

_You will need to insert your own MySQL username in place of `[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE]` and MySQL password in place of `[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE]`._

## Known Bugs

* _None at the moment_
